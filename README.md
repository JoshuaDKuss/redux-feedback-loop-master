# Project Name
Redux Feedback Loop


## Description

This project is a feedback form, built as an app. It asks the user 3 questions and then asks for any comments the user may have. We used React with Redux, plus Axios and Node.js.

----Checklist----

install npm dependencies & redux - 
run server and client
create components (body, Q's 1-4, header)
route paths in app
feedback router to be used later
added style (personal preference, I like it to look like my own build while I'm putting in the guts)
added inputs and submit buttons to Q1-Q4
setup redux, import routers, fix links
create more components (review, awesome)
send feedback to server and check to see if database gets the inputs
add goofy gif to awesome page
add a restart button and clear inputs/values


What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

I had issues with my reducer, I tried many things before getting a glimmer of hope. Also, I had bad syntax in the handleChange's for a while, and using reduxState was kinda wonky at first. I got a lot of help from my cohort-mates and my programmer friend. The redux stuff is still weird to me but I'm getting it.
